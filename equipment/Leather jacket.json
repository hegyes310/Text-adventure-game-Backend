	"Name": "Leather jacket",
	"Description": "The leather jacket does not provide sufficient protection from the Zone's harsh conditions, since it's simply a leather anorak with blue trousers tucked into hiking boots. Typically, it's also worn with a backpack with extra straps across the chest. The leather jacket offers little protection from gunfire or claws and it's absolutely useless against radiation or anomalies.",
