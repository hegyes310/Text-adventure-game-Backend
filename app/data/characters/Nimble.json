	"Name": "Nimble",
	"Background": "A very resourceful and lucky person, Nimble is a survivor - he always seems to live to fight another day. Thus far, he has survived the destruction of the Clear Sky faction, being captured by bandits and managed to establish a profitable gun running business. Part of that is thanks to his two talents: staying unseen and remaining useful. Nimble is well connected to the underground market thanks to his time with Sidorovich. He has also worked for other traders, establishing a reputation as an indispensable agent who can be trusted with truly sensitive missions. Connections he made while working with Sidorovich will later allow him to start his own business, stating he's not interested in working for people anymore."
